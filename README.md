# Job Portal Application

## Problem Statement

In today's job market, both job seekers and recruiters face several challenges and issues during the job search and recruitment process. Job seekers, particularly college students and fresh graduates, often lack awareness of suitable opportunities based on their skill set. Moreover, job postings on various platforms may be incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate, requiring job seekers to exercise judgment and conduct due diligence. Additionally, these platforms lack identity verification, factual information, company verification, and a platform for applicants and current/past employees to provide feedback.

Recruiters also encounter difficulties, as applicants may list skills on their resumes without concrete evidence or validation of their proficiency. This poses challenges for recruiters in verifying the accuracy of stated skills and assessing actual competency.

## Solution

To address these issues, we propose building a job portal application that caters to both job seekers and recruiters. The application will allow companies and job seekers to register, provided they have been properly identified and verified (including skill set verification for job applicants). The app will offer various features in addition to being a job portal.
