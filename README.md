# SecureJobPortal

Problem Statement:

In today’s job market, there are several challenges and issues that individuals and organizations face during the job search and recruitment process. As College students or fresh graduates, job seekers are not much aware of the opportunities they might get based on their skill set. Some job postings on various platforms nowadays may need to be updated, complete, or accurate. Job seekers must exercise judgment and conduct due diligence when evaluating job opportunities. These platforms don’t provide identity, facts, company verification, and a place for applicants and current and past employees to give feedback.

Recruiters also need help with various problems. Applicants may list skills on their resumes without giving concrete evidence or validation of their proficiency which poses a challenge for recruiters in verifying the accuracy of the stated skills and assessing their actual competency.

Solution:

To resolve these issues, we aim to build an application for those seeking job opportunities and recruiters. Both the companies and the job seekers are allowed to be registered on our portal provided they have been properly identified and verified (verification of skill sets incase of job applicants). The app will also contain many other features along with being a job portal.
